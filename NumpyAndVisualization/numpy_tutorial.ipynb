    "[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a powerful toolkit for the handling of large N-dimensional arrays or matrices, conveniently wrapped in Python. Given the relative inefficiencies of large Pythonic lists of numbers, Numpy [`ndarray`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html)s are the backbone of scientific computation in Python. In this notebook we'll first show some time comparisons between `ndarray` and Python list basic functions, then explore a some of the very useful Numpy methods. Implicit in some of the later material will be the use of Matplotlib to visualize some of the multidimensional array data that we're manipulating.\n",

    "We know Python lists as a really easy-to-use list implementation including powerful object-oriented and functional methods, where elements of a list can be of any type. This flexibility of the list type is accomplished through the use of pointers in a way that is hidden from the programmer--under the hood. Numpy on the other hand constrains all elements of an `ndarray` to be of the same type; under the hood, numpy arrays can be stored in contiguous memory with constant access time. \n",

    "To demonstrate this, we'll make a Python list of random integers using numpy's [randint](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.randint.html), a (uniformly distributed) random number generator. We'll also make a numpy `ndarray` copy of that list. This copy will be in memory that is independent of the list, which we are just copying the values from. \n",

In that there is always some baseline overhead cost due to the Python interpreter (as opposed to compiled library calls), you may notice that the speedup improves the larger the list size is made to be. I observed a ~12x speedup on a list size of 10000, and a 15-20x speedup beyond 100000. "

    "One significant note here is that there is a big precision reduction: the *integer* primitive in Python is for arbitrary magnitude integral values and requires 28 bytes, while the implicitly determined `np.int64` requires only 8 bytes. In conjunction with the direct packing (instead of pointer packing) in memory, the `ndarray` variable `np_lyst` requires much less memory than the Python variable `lyst`, and could engender much better cache coherence (read: average memory access time). Read more about it [here](https://webcourses.ucf.edu/courses/1249560/pages/python-lists-vs-numpy-arrays-what-is-the-difference). Additionally it is possible to write your own efficient C code implmentations that can be called from Python: read (much) more [here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/beating-numpy-performance-by-extending-python-with-c-c9b644ee2ca8).\n",
