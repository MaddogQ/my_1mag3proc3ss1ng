    "[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a highly customizable visualization toolkit for Python. So highly customizable in terms of fonts, interactivity, and animations that we cannot possibly cover it in a short notebook like this. For more complete coverage and documentation you should definitely look to the [matplotlib tutorials](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html) online. \n",
