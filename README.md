## imageprocessing
### [Joshua Stough](http://joshuastough.com), 202-

***This book is under construction and not at all ready for showtime! The interactive visualizations do not yet work in Colab. Please come back later.***

I am writing a book on introductory image processing in [Python](https://www.python.org/about/). For the sake of immediacy and usability, all content and code examples are in the form of IPython notebooks that (at some point will) execute in Google Colab.
